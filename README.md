### ðŸ”· How To Create A Template

1. You need to prepare an image.
   > The image should be ready (properly resized).
2. Go to https://imgur.com or any other image hosting platform and upload your image.

   > The image URL should end with the correct image format, such as .png, .webp, etc.

   > To get the correct URL after a successful upload, right-click and choose either "Copy image address" or "Open image in a new tab," then copy the URL.

   > The image you are using should be pixel-perfect sized with the canvas. This means, for example, you cannot use a 1600x1200 image to fit a 25x10 space.

3. Preparing the template.

   1. Go to: https://rentry.co
   2. Enter the base template:
      ```json
      {
        "contact": "https://github.com/shaanaliyev",
        "templates": [
          {
            "name": "NAME_YOUR_ART",
            "sources": ["PASTE_IMAGE_URL_HERE"],
            "x": 0,
            "y": 0
          }
        ]
      }
      ```
   3. Replace the data with yours.
      - `name`: Can be anything.
      - `sources`: Paste the image URL that you prepared.
      - `x` and `y`: Top-left starting points for your art on the canvas.
        > The script takes (0, 0) as the starting points. So, you need some calculations here. If you want to go down, add to `y`; if you want to go right, add to `x`.
   4. Click "Go" > "Export" > "Raw" and copy the URL.

      > Done! This is your Template URL. Share this URL with others to collaborate together.

      > They need to follow the ["How to use"](#-how-to-use) section to use the template.

Extra:

> You can update the template on (https://rentry.co) by clicking the edit button anytime you need. The users will get the update automatically just after they refresh the r/place page.

> Also, you can work on multiple images following this syntax:
>
> ```json
> {
>   "contact": "https://github.com/shaanaliyev",
>   "templates": [
>     {
>       "name": "NAME_YOUR_ART_1",
>       "sources": ["PASTE_IMAGE_1_URL_HERE"],
>       "x": 0,
>       "y": 0
>     },
>     {
>       "name": "NAME_YOUR_ART_2",
>       "sources": ["PASTE_IMAGE_2_URL_HERE"],
>       "x": 0,
>       "y": 0
>     }
>   ]
> }
